The data we chose for the project is the 2006 Speed Dating Dataset gathered by three professors of Columbia Business School: Sheena Iyengar, Emir Kamenica, Itamar Simonson. The dataset and the data key of the experiment can be found on the website  https://data.world/annavmontoya/speed-dating-experiment. The webpage archive of the experiment conducted is https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/researcharchive/articles/867.

This data was found as part of an experiment that involved finding the major factors which affect the decision of people from both genders if they would consider someone from the opposite sex as their partner. In this experiment, every participant is allowed to meet every other participant of the opposite gender, and the rating is given based on the participant’s perception during a four-minute conversation.

The main conclusions from the experiment are as follows -

* Women generally give more importance to the intelligence and the race of their partner
* Men are more responsive to physical attractiveness. 
* The majority of men don’t give much value or importance to women’s intelligence or ambition when it exceeds their own.
* Women tend to prefer men who grew up in affluent neighborhoods. 
* Male selectivity is invariant to group size, while female selectivity is strongly increasing in group size.

We aim to visualize and verify these results and different patterns through various graphs, plots, and different visualization techniques. We also want to analyze and find some underlying or hidden patterns from the dataset which have not been explored yet. 

List of questions we are interested in pursuing:

1. The nature of the event from which the data was collected in this case follows that every participant is allowed to meet every other participant of the opposite gender, and the rating is given based on the participant’s perception during the 4 min conversation. 
    1. Does this subjective perception depend on the order in which the participants have met each other? 
    2. Statistically speaking, are the events of rating participants given they are all coming from a single participant, independent of the ratings of events that occurred before that meeting?
2. What are the major factors which both genders consider important for them to go on a second date? 
3. There are six main attributes that every participant is rated against. Are participants’ responses to these factors biased towards other attributes like race, school of study, and geographic home location? For instance, validating whether a participant from one department is likely to say yes to a participant from the same department.
4. Is self-perception of certain qualities on the same page as to how others perceive it? Are participants overestimating or underestimating what one thinks of oneself? 
5. Is the sample of students participating in this research experience truly randomized, or is there a group of people overrepresented? In other words, is there a selection bias?

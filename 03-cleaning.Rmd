# Data transformation


## For static plots
Here is the process on how we transformed our data.

Firstly, since there were a lot of problems with waves up to 9, we decided to exclude it from our analysis. We found most of our results using waves 10-21. However, some results related to entire populations and hence used data for all waves.

Moreover, there are too many variables recorded in the experiment. We picked a few important ones for our analysis. We chose 12 important variables along with 3 variables which answered survey questions for each wave. The 12 important variables we chose are:

*1. iid: unique subject number, grouped by wave id gender*

*2. pid: partnerâ€™s iid number*

*3. gender:	Female = 0,	Male = 1*

*4. match: 1 = yes, 0 = no*

*5. age: age of subject*

*6. field: field of study*

*7. race: Black/African American = 1,*
	    *European/Caucasian-American = 2,*
    	*Latino/Hispanic American = 3,*
    	*Asian/Pacific Islander/Asian-American = 4,*
    	*Native American = 5,*
    	*Other = 6*
    	
*8. from: Where are you from originally (before coming to Columbia)? *

*9. income: Median household income based on zipcode*

*10. goal: What is your primary goal in participating in this event? *
	    *Seemed like a fun night out = 1,*
    	*To meet new people = 2,*
    	*To get a date = 3,*
    	*Looking for a serious relationship = 4,*
    	*To say I did it = 5,*
    	*Other = 6*

*11. career: What is your intended career?*

*12. wave: wave number*

These are the common variables we chose to analyze missing values. There were several questions in this experiment, but we chose three in specific, which were most relevant to our project and analyzed missing values for all three questions separately.

The three questions are:

**Question 1_1:**

**We want to know what you look for in the opposite sex.**

*13. attr1_1: Attractive*

*14. sinc1_1: Sincere*

*15. intel1_1: Intelligent*

*16. fun1_1: Fun*

*17. amb1_1: Ambitious*

These are the 5 other variables of question 1_1.


**Question 2_1:**

**What do you think the opposite sex looks for in a date?**

*13. att2_1: Attractive*

*14. sinc2_1: Sincere*

*15. intel2_1: Intelligent*

*16. fun2_1: Fun*

*17. amb2_1: Ambitious*

These are the 5 other variables of question 2_1.


**Question 4_1:**

**Now we want to know what you think MOST of your fellow men/women look for in the opposite sex**

*13. attr4_1: Attractive*

*14. sinc4_1: Sincere*

*15. intel4_1: Intelligent*

*16. fun4_1: Fun*

*17. amb4_1: Ambitious*

These are the 5 other variables of question 4_1.

## For interactive plots

For the interactive plot, we made alluvial plots with two axes (representing two distinct characteristics of the students participating). We chose five characteristic features of the students: *field, gender, race, from and career.* For each of these, we can view the flow of people on what characteristics they belong to. For the aforementioned columns too, we chose a specific subset of observations to best represent our visualization (in terms of random selection of sample and best look). The steps for the pre processing is mentioned here:

First, since we expected the students' field and intended career will be the same most of the time, we plotted only the ones where their career and field were not the same text field. Also, some people entered `?` or `??` for their career, so we removed those observations. Also, to make things look clean, we removed the cases where the text entered in the field and career were more than 10 characters. For the `from` column, we removed the observations with more than 15 characters.

The code for this part of the pre processing can be found here: https://github.com/amruthasundar/final-edav-project/blob/main/d3/d3_pre_processing.Rmd.

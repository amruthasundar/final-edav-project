The data we are using for the project is the 2006 Speed Dating Dataset gathered by three professors of Columbia Business School: Sheena Iyengar, Emir Kamenica, Itamar Simonson. The dataset and the data key of the experiment can be found on the website https://data.world/annavmontoya/speed-dating-experiment. The webpage archive of the experiment conducted is https://www8.gsb.columbia.edu/researcharchive/articles/867. Data Source: https://data.world/annavmontoya/speed-dating-experiment This data was found as part of an experiment that involved finding the major factors which affect the decision of people from both genders if they would consider someone from the opposite sex as their partner. In this experiment, every participant is allowed to meet every other participant of the opposite gender, and the rating is given based on the participant’s perception during a four-minute conversation.

The main conclusions from the experiment were as follows - Women generally give more importance to the intelligence and the race of their partner Men are more responsive to physical attractiveness. The majority of men don’t give much value or importance to women’s intelligence or ambition when it exceeds their own. Women tend to prefer men who grew up in affluent neighborhoods. Male selectivity is invariant to group size, while female selectivity is strongly increasing in group size. We aim to visualize and verify these results and different patterns through various graphs, plots, and different visualization techniques. We also want to analyze and find some underlying or hidden patterns from the dataset which have not been explored yet.

The dates of the experiments are given below: Wave 01: Oct 16, 2002 Wave 02: Oct 23, 2002 Wave 03: Nov 12, 2002 Wave 04: Nov 12, 2002 Wave 05: Nov 20, 2002 Wave 06: Mar 26, 2003 Wave 07: Mar 26, 2003 Wave 08: Apr 02, 2003 Wave 09: Apr 02, 2003 Wave 10: Sep 24, 2003 Wave 11: Sep 24, 2003 Wave 12: Oct 07, 2003 Wave 13: Oct 08, 2003 Wave 14: Oct 08, 2003 Wave 15: Feb 24, 2004 Wave 16: Feb 25, 2004 Wave 17: Feb 25, 2004 Wave 18: Apr 06, 2004 Wave 19: Apr 06, 2004 Wave 20: Apr 07, 2004 Wave 21: Apr 07, 2004 The experiment included every participant speed dating every participant from the opposite sex for four minutes, and after each 4 minute session, they were asked to fill a questionnaire of questions that asked them to rate their partner in terms of Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, Ambition, and Shared Interests. Moreover, they were asked if they would date them again. Demographic data of each participant was also collected for the purpose of the analysis. 2.2 Data Description All the data collected was given in a single CSV file with 195 columns and 8373 observations. Most of the variables given are numbers, either of the type integer of numeric, since they are mostly about ratings. However, variables such as field, from location, career, etc. were character fields. 2.3 Issues with the data We noticed that in different waves, the data For example, the ratings asked in waves 6-9 were ratings on a scale from 1 to 10. For all other waves, they were asked for a 100 point allocation instead. Some questions required distribute the 100 points among the six attributes. This made the units different for different questions. Also, some questions were introduced after the 9th wave, and hence has all values missing for waves 1-9. Moreover, some questions did not have the option of rating for Shared Interests, while some did. This brought a mismatch in the number of columns (answers) per question. Also, some questions relating to final decisions were sensitive and hence data on those questions were never published. Hence we had to make use of the data that was available. "],["data-transformation.html", "Chapter 3 Data transformation", " Chapter 3 Data transformation Here is the process on how we transformed our data. Firstly, since there were a lot of problems with waves up to 9, we decided to exclude it from our analysis. We found most of our results using waves 10-21. However, some results related to entire populations and hence used data for all waves. Moreover, there are too many variables recorded in the experiment. We picked a few important ones for our analysis. We chose 12 important variables along with 3 variables which answered survey questions for each wave. The 12 important variables we chose are: 1. iid: unique subject number, grouped by wave id gender 2. pid: partner’s iid number 3. gender: Female = 0, Male = 1 4. match: 1 = yes, 0 = no 5. age: age of subject 6. field: field of study 7. race: Black/African American = 1, European/Caucasian-American = 2, Latino/Hispanic American = 3, Asian/Pacific Islander/Asian-American = 4, Native American = 5, Other = 6 8. from: Where are you from originally (before coming to Columbia)? 9. income: Median household income based on zipcode 10. goal: What is your primary goal in participating in this event? Seemed like a fun night out = 1, To meet new people = 2, To get a date = 3, Looking for a serious relationship = 4, To say I did it = 5, Other = 6 11. career: What is your intended career? 12. wave: wave number These are the common variables we chose to analyze missing values. There were several questions in this experiment, but we chose three in specific, which were most relevant to our project and analyzed missing values for all three questions separately. The three questions are: Question 1_1: We want to know what you look for in the opposite sex. 13. attr1_1: Attractive 14. sinc1_1: Sincere 15. intel1_1: Intelligent 16. fun1_1: Fun 17. amb1_1: Ambitious These are the 5 other variables of question 1_1. Question 2_1: What do you think the opposite sex looks for in a date? 13. att2_1: Attractive 14. sinc2_1: Sincere 15. intel2_1: Intelligent 16. fun2_1: Fun 17. amb2_1: Ambitious These are the 5 other variables of question 2_1. Question 4_1: Now we want to know what you think MOST of your fellow men/women look for in the opposite sex 13. attr4_1: Attractive 14. sinc4_1: Sincere 15. intel4_1: Intelligent 16. fun4_1: Fun 17. amb4_1: Ambitious These are the 5 other variables of question 4_1.

"],["missing-values.html", "Chapter 4 Missing values 4.1 Number of missing attributes for each wave per question - Bar plots and Cleaveland Plots 4.2 Heatmap 4.3 Missing patterns question", " Chapter 4 Missing values For the missing values chapter, we chose slightly more variables than the ones mentioned in the previous chapters. This is to represent a more general version of the missing value patterns in the data set. 4.1 Number of missing attributes for each wave per question - Bar plots and Cleaveland Plots First, we plotted a barplot of the maximum number of missing answers given (for variables 13 - 17) per wave for each question. This helps us understand which waves had people that had a considerable amount of missing values for each question. For Question 1_1: For Question 1_1 We can observe that in waves 2, 3, 6, 13, and 14; there are people who did not answer any of the 5 attributes in question 1_1. In wave 5, the maximum number of missing attributes is 1, so everyone rated at least 4 of 5 attributes. In all other waves, all attributes were answered by everyone. For Question 2_1: For Question 2_1 Same as question 1_1, we can observe that in waves 2, 3, 6, 13, and 14; there are people who did not answer any of the 5 attributes in question 2_1. In wave 5, the maximum number of missing attributes is 1, so everyone rated at least 4 of 5 attributes. In all other waves, all attributes were answered by everyone. For Question 3_1: For Question 3_1 We can observe that in waves 2, 3, 6, 13, 14, 15 and 16; there are people who did not answer any of the 5 attributes in question 3_1. In all other waves, all attributes were answered by everyone. Here, the maximum number of missing answers given are all or none. For Question 4_1: For Question 4_1 We can observe that in waves 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 13, and 14; there are people who did not answer any of the 5 attributes in question 4_1. In all other waves, all attributes were answered by everyone. Here too, the maximum number of missing answers given are all or none. For Question 5_1: For Question 5_1 We can observe that in waves 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 14, 15, and 16; there are people who did not answer any of the 5 attributes in question 5_1. In all other waves, all attributes were answered by everyone. Here too, the maximum number of missing answers given are all or none. 4.2 Heatmap The above plots are only furnishing information regarding the count of missing values. We can drill down to check missing values by wave. Heatmaps are one way to visualize the details of missing columns. Below plots show an example of heatmaps for several questions across a single wave. For Question 1_1 and wave 5 For Question 1_1 and wave 6 For Question 2_1 and wave 5 For Question 2_1 and wave 6 4.3 Missing patterns question Since we have 8378 observations, we used row percentages instead of row count in our missing values plot. Below are the plots for missing values per question. For question 1_1: We can observe that we have 9 missing value patterns in the data for question 1_1. We can see that almost above 90% of the observations come under the complete cases pattern. The second most observed pattern is that there is missing values for attractiveness, sincerity, intelligence, fun, ambitious, age, goal, and race. The third most observed pattern is that there is missing values only for age. Moreover, we observe that about 14% of the rows have a missing value for ambitious, which is the highest percentage of missing rows for question 1_1. The second most missing column is age, with slightly lower than 14% of the rows missing it; followed by fun, with about 13% of the rows missing it. For question 2_1: We can observe that we have 8 missing value patterns in the data for question 2_1. We can see that almost above 90% of the observations come under the complete cases pattern. The second most observed pattern is that there is missing values for attractiveness, sincerity, intelligence, fun, ambitious, age, goal, and race. The third most observed pattern is that there is missing values only for age. Moreover, we observe that about 14% of the rows have a missing value for age, which is the highest percentage of missing rows for question 2_1. The second most missing column is ambitious, with about 13% of the rows missing it; followed by fun, with about 12% of the rows missing it. For question 3_1: We can observe that we have 7 missing value patterns in the data for question 3_1. We can see that almost above 90% of the observations come under the complete cases pattern. The second most observed pattern is that there is missing values for attractiveness, sincerity, intelligence, fun, ambitious, age, goal, and race. The third most observed pattern is that there is missing values only for age. Moreover, we observe that all five attributes, attractiveness, sincerity, intelligence, fun, and ambitious are missing in about 13.5% of the rows, which is the highest percentage of missing rows for question 3_1. The second most missing column is age, with about 12.5% of the rows missing it; followed by goal, with about 10% of the rows missing it. For question 4_1: We can observe that we have 8 missing value patterns in the data for question 4_1. We can see that almost above 75% of the observations come under the complete cases pattern. About 20% of the observations have missing values for for all five attributes, i.e., attractiveness, sincerity, intelligence, fun, and ambitious. The second most observed pattern is that there is missing values for all five attributes, i.e., attractiveness, sincerity, intelligence, fun, and ambitious. The third most observed pattern is that there is missing values for attractiveness, sincerity, intelligence, fun, ambitious, age, goal, and race. Moreover, we observe that all five attributes, attractiveness, sincerity, intelligence, fun, and ambitious are missing in about 19% of the rows, which is the highest percentage of missing rows for question 4_1. The second most missing column is age, with about 1% of the rows missing it; followed by goal, with less than 1% of the rows missing it. For question 5_1: We can observe that we have 8 missing value patterns in the data for question 5_1. We can see that almost 58% of the observations come under the complete cases pattern. About 20% of the observations have missing values for for all five attributes, i.e., attractiveness, sincerity, intelligence, fun, and ambitious. The second most observed pattern is that there is missing values for all five attributes, i.e., attractiveness, sincerity, intelligence, fun, and ambitious. The third most observed pattern is that there is missing values for attractiveness, sincerity, intelligence, fun, ambitious, age, goal, and race. Moreover, we observe that all five attributes, attractiveness, sincerity, intelligence, fun, and ambitious are missing in about 20% of the rows, which is the highest percentage of missing rows for question 5_1. The second most missing column is age, with about 1% of the rows missing it; followed by goal, with less than 1% of the rows missing it. We have noted only the top three of the most seen pattern and the number of missing rows per column. However, we could bot make a note for others as their percentages are too small to interpret from the plot.

This answers the question if the sample of students participating in this research experiment is truly randomized. This can help us know if there is/are a group of people that is/are over-represented. In other words, it tells us about the selection bias. We have chosen four characteristics of the participants: field of study, age, race, and intended career. Here are the bar plots for the same. Note: The field, race, and career codes are summarized in the data key. Here are the inferences from these plots: 1. For field of study We can see that about 23% of the participants are from the 8th field of study, which is Business/Econ/Finance. This represents the highest percentage of students. Considering that this experiment was conducted by professors from the Columbia Business School, a lot of students from that field were expected. This is followed by fields 10 (Biological Sciences/Chemistry/Physics) and 5 (Engineering) representing the 2nd and 3rd highest percentages. The 17th field of study, which is Architecture, constitutes about less than 1% of the participants. This is the least represented group in terms of field of study. Before that, comes field 12 (undecided), before which comes field 18 (other). 2. For age group We can observe that most students are between the age 20 and 30, with about 68 people with age around 27. Almost all the participants are between 18 and 39 years of age, with the exception of a few of age 42 and 55. 3. For race We can observe that race 2, which is European/Caucasian-American is the highest represented group here, which has about 4700 participants. Second most highest represented race is 4, i.e., Asian/Pacific Islander/Asian-American with about 2000 participants. The count for race not specified is the least among all the races. Apart from that, the least represented race is Black/African American with about 450 participants. 4. For intended career Here, we can observe that the intended career of most students is career 2 and 7, i.e., Academic/Research and Banking/Consulting/Finance/Marketing/Business/CEO/Entrepreneur/Admin respectively. They constitute for about 155 and 135 participants respectively. The least represented career field is career 17, which is Architecture. Similar trend was seen in the representation by field of study. 5.2 Number of yes matches per participant In the original experiment, the variable match is the target variable. This indicates if the person was matched to the other person or not. We can use a Cleveland dot plot to show the number of yes matches each participant got. As mentioned before, we are using waves 10-21. Moreover, we faceted them by waves and color coded by the gender so we can also understand patterns among genders and within individual waves. Here, we can observe that the maximum number of yes matches of participants in waves 10 and 13 is always less than 5. Also, the highest number of matches for waves 20 and 18 is 3. Waves 11, 14, 15, 18 and 21 have a wide variety of matches for different people. Moreover, all waves have participants who are not matched with other people. The number of participants across all waves who did not get matched seem to have an even number of males and females. The most matched participant is a female from wave 21 who got 14 matches. 5.3 Analysing correlation between the chosen variables One of the important questions we want to address is visualizing whether the features in the dataset exhibit correlation among themselves or with the target variable that tells whether the pair matched or not. This is important as it will help us come up with blatant patterns observed in features that help in formulations of simple if-then rules. For the purposes of this visualization, we have narrowed down comparison of ratings to a specific question that were asked prior to the event - Distribute a score of 100 among the five attributes in the order of importance that you would like to see in your potential date. This question is interesting to inspect if the attributes of what people look for in their potential partners bear any correlation among themselves and also with the actual number of people they agreed to match with. Some of the interesting inferences we can make regarding the plots are, The distribution of most of the attributes are close to normal except for ambition with seems to be right skewed. A relatively high number of participants have given a low priority to ambition of their potential partners as a deciding factor. While most of the features are weakly negatively correlated almost exhibiting no correlation at all, the pair of feature sincerity, attractiveness and sincerity, intelligence are negatively correlated by the greatest amount. This tells us that people who gave a high preference to sincerity gave a low preference to intelligence and attractiveness and the other set of people weighed attractiveness and intelligence over sincerity. The age of the participants are mostly between 20 and 30, while one senior participant over 50 did not match with anyone, evident by the anomaly of the farthest point in the age vs total_matches plot. The trend that is seen in all the plots of attributes of attractiveness, sincerity, intelligence, fun and ambition is that, as the rating or the priority of certain feature increases, the number of matches goes down, for a few points. This is justifiable with the points that are to the farthest right at the bottom. This is expected as participants who have a really high expectation on one feature might not find someone suitable to meet their high expectations on that feature. It is interesting to note that the same plot of features vs total matches also exhibits some anomaly. There seems to be one point in all these plots that have a relatively medium level rating/priority while the number of matches is pretty high. This can be verified by the top most point to the left of the plots. There were some participants who are estimated to have based their criteria of matching on factors others that the ones that were rated on. This can be infered as they have a relatively high number of matches than their peers who matched less, given the same priority for those features. 5.4 Analysis of decision making on Race One of the factors of taken into consideration for understanding the requirements of participant’s expectation with their partners is the Race. Each participant is required to report a rating out of 10 for their potential partner to be of the same race as them. This visualization is to analyze whether the actual decision of the partcipants is influenced by any other factors that overpowers them to match with their dates from Race other than their own. The following hexmap is a visual of Proportion of Matches that interested the participants from the same Race vs Importance of Race reported before the actual experiment. The hexmap uncovers some interesting patterns observed from the participants’ responses, There are instances of participants matching with only participants of different Races irrespective of their response to Importance of same Race. This indicates that Race is clearly not the sole factor for making a decision of matching with people. There is one anomaly at the top right hex cell which has the highest count of people matching with participants of the same Race despite giving a lower priority on importance of same Race. The count of people who have a high importance to matching with the same Race but indeed have agreed to match with the same Race are relatively low. This is indicated by light green hex patches implying a lower frequency of people matching within their own race. The presence of hexagons on the lower proportion of matches within the same race for higher values of importance of Race is intriguing. From this we can infer that participants who were strongly inclined to match with their own Race, changed their mind after the experiment. This gives a clear indicator that other attributes of a person overpowered their mindset of same Race. 5.5 Attribute Rating Analysis by Race From the previous plot we inferred that certain attributes are strong enough to change participant’s prior perception of importance of Race. Diving further, we want to understand how the attributes are rated for differently across the Race of the participants. This sheds light on how certain group of participants, characteristically from a certain Race, have prioritized attributes in their potential partners. Below is a mosaic plot for two specific features - attractiveness and ambition as independent features and visualized by Race as the dependent variable. Some of the inferences we can draw from the above mosaic plots of attributes - attractiveness and ambition are, Race 2 - Majority of the participants are from Race 2 and the distribution of importance for ambition is split from 0 to 20. The same 5.6 Change of feature perception with time Here, our objective is to find that if a participant’s perspective (ratings) on which features they are looking for in the opposite sex change with time, especially before and after the speed dating experiment. For this part, we chose one question in particular from the survey: What you look for in the opposite sex? Now, this question was asked to the same people multiple times. We specifically choose three times. The times we chose were: Asked before the speed dating experiment Asked the day after the speed dating experiment Asked 3-4 weeks after the speed dating experiment To answer our question, we decided to use parallel coordinate axis plots since it helps us to visualize multiple variables at once and also account for correlations among the variables by comparing the direction of the lines (which are our participants in this case). We color coded them by gender to find more inferences. Again, we used waves 10-21 for this plot. We did this for each of the five features: Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun, and Ambition. We normalized the values of each variable in the plots using the uniminmax scale. We did not use splines because we believe we lost information if we include it. Here are the plots: Here are the interpretations from the above plot: 1) For Attractiveness Since most lines go slightly upwards from attr1_1 to attr1_2, we can say that people give slightly more importance to the attractiveness of the other person a day after the speed dating experiment. From attr1_2 to attr1_3, most lines go upward but some go downward. Hence, in general, most people give significant importance to the attractiveness of the partner. We can observe that few people drastically bring their rating from 25% to 100%, while some people reach 0% rating in 3-4 weeks. In general, the importance of attractiveness usually keeps increasing for males more, while there is no pattern for females. However, the increase of importance for females is more drastic in females. 2) For Sincerity Since most lines go upwards from sinc1_1 to sinc1_2, we can say that people give more importance to the sincerity of the other person the next day. From sinc1_2 to sinc1_3, most lines go downward indicating that as most time passes (line 3-4 weeks), most people give less importance to the sincerity of the partner. For females, the importance of sincerity increases the day after the experiment, but reduces drastically in 3-4 weeks. For males, their sincerity importance level remained steady with time. 3) For Intelligence Most lines go upwards from intel1_1 to intel1_2, some go downward, and some remain steady (especially the one with zero rating). Generally speaking, we can say that people give more intelligence to the sincerity right after the speed dating experiment. From intel1_2 to intel1_3, most lines remain steady, many go downward, and some go upward indicating that as most people remain around at similar levels or remain indifferent of their partner’s intelligence. For most males, the importance of intelligence increased after the experiment and remained steady afterward. For most females, it first increased too and then decreased. 4) For Fun There does not seem to be a pattern from fun1_1 to fun1_2 or from fun1_2 to fun1_3 since many lines go upward and downward both times. Moreover, the variation in the range of ratings keep increasing from fun1_1 to fun1_3. Here too, the ratings of people with zero rating remained steady. No pattern is observed for particular genders. 5) For Ambition Since most lines go upwards from amb1_1 to amb1_2, we can say that people give more importance to the ambition of the other person the next day. From amb1_2 to amb1_3, most lines go downward indicating that as most time passes (line 3-4 weeks), most people give less importance to the ambition of the partner. Here too, the ratings of people with zero rating remained steady. Moreover, some drastic increase (about 60% to 100%) and decrease (60% to 0%) of the importance of ambition is observed from amb1_1 to amb1_3. For females, the importance of ambition increased after the experiment, but decreased again in 3-4 weeks. For males, there seems to be an even distribution of people with increasing and decreasing importance. 5.7 Importance of attributes for each gender group Before the Speed Dating experiment all the participants were asked to rate how important are these five attributes – Ambition, Attractiveness, Fun, Intelligence, Sincerity. They were asked to distribute 100 points across these attributes. It can be observed from the 1st plot that that most women before the Speed Dating Experiment rated Intelligence as most important attribute followed by Sincerity then Attractiveness. Whereas after the experiment women rated Attractiveness as the most important attribute followed by Intelligence then Sincerity. It can be observed from the 2nd plot that most men before the Speed Dating Experiment rated Attractiveness as most important attribute followed by Intelligence then Fun. Even after the Experiment men rated Attractiveness as the most important attribute followed by Fun then Intelligence. For both gender groups it can be observed that Ambition has been rated as the least important attribute. To female, the top three attributes are Intelligence, Sincerity and Attractiveness, while to male, they were Attractiveness, Intelligence and Fun. Also, it can be observed that men tended to have more distinctive preference whereas women’s preference appeared to be more even. 5.8 Perception of different groups of people regarding importance of attributes Before the Speed Dating experiment all the participants were asked to rate how important are these five attributes – Ambition, Attractiveness, Fun, Intelligence, Sincerity. They were asked to distribute 100 points across these attributes. They were also asked to rate what they think opposite sex would rate and what fellow women/men would rate how important the attributes are. We get this information from the questions 1_1, 2_1, 4_1 for the data before experiment and 1_2, 2_2, 4_2 for the data after experiment. We plotted the average rating given by individual vs the rating given by opposite sex vs the rating of what fellow women/men would rate the attributes. It can be observed from the plot that most women do not consider Attractiveness to be an important attribute but think that fellow women consider Attractiveness to be an important attribute. Similarly, even men think that women consider Attractiveness to be most important attribute but in real life women consider Intelligence to be the most important attribute. It can be observed from the plot that men consider Attractiveness to be the most important attribute and also perceive that the fellow men also have same perception that Attractiveness is the most important attribute. It can also be observed that the women’s perception of what men think the most important attribute is correct as most women gave high rating for what men might rate for each attribute. Overall, it can be observed that women’s perception of what men consider about each attribute is very accurate whereas men’s perception of what women might consider as important attributes is inaccurate (It can be seen in the difference between the pink bar and blue bar). 5.9 Satisfaction score vs. number of matches We plotted a heatmap to see the how the number of matches and the satisfaction score are distributed for the participants. The number of matches signifies the number of people they want to go on a 2nd date with and the satisfaction score signifies how satisfied they are with the experiment. We are calculating the frequency for the pairs of number of matches and satisfaction score. And plotting a heatmap to see what is the highest frequency pair. From the first heatmap plotted for the females we can see that there are many people with 1 match and satisfaction score more than 5. Similar observations can be seen in the 2nd heatmap as well which is plotted for the males. Overall, we can observe that people with lesser number of matches are more satisfied with the experiment. We can also infer than there are no females with 9, 11,12,13 number of matches. The data is left skewed as there are more people with 5 or lesser number of matches. Hence the plot is darker towards the left-hand side. We can also see that there are more people with satisfaction score of 5 or higher. 5.10 Actual vs. Personal perception The participants were asked to rate themselves over the five attributes (Attractiveness, Sincerity, Intelligence, Fun and Ambition) on a scale of 1- 10 (1 being awful and 10 being great) they were also asked to rate their partners over these 5 attributes after each four-minute first date and were also asked how do they think others perceive them. The data for these questions is stored in questions 3_1, attr_o and 5_1 respectively. The participants were asked the same questions after the experiment as well the results for the questions are stored in 3_2 and 5_2 respectively. We plotted box plots of the data to compare people’s actual rating vs self-perception vs what the participants assumed they would potentially receive. It can be observed while comparing self-ratings and the actual ratings, that the participants did generally overestimate themselves. The attribute that they overestimated the most was fun while the one that overestimated the least was intelligence. Females overestimated the attribute sincerity, most of the women rated themselves 9/10 where as most women received a score of 7/10. Whereas men overestimated the fun attribute most of the men rated themselves 8/10 but most received a score of 6.5/10. It can also be seen from the results that most women increased their self-rating for the attributes after the experiment except from sincerity whereas most men decreased their self-rating for sincerity and fun. When comparing their assumed partner’s ratings and the actual ratings, we saw that while the participants knew that they were underestimated, the ratings they perceived were even lower than they thought over every attribute. "],["interactive-component.html", "Chapter 6 Interactive component", " Chapter 6 Interactive component For the interactive component, we aimed to show the flow of the number of people from one characteristic to another. For example, we tried to find how many students from which gender went into which field of their career. If we used five characteristics and wanted to find the flow from one to each other, it would require 20 static plots and would be very confusing to interpret. Hence, we created an interactive alluvial diagram with two axis which can be chosen by the user. Moreover, as mentioned in the data transformation chapter, we chose a specific subset of our data for this plot. Also, we chose five characteristic features of the students: field, gender, race, from and career. Instructions for interactivity: Below are two buttons which can help you choose your first and the second axis for the alluvial diagram. After choosing the two axes, clicking on the plot button will plot the diagram. Now, for both the axes, you can hover over any strata to find out how many students belong to that category. You can also drag the strata up or down to change its position. Moreover, if you hover on a flow or an alluvium, it will tell you how many people which of the left axis category belong to which category in the right axis category. Note: Since it does not make sense to have an alluvial diagram with two axes but the same column, there will be no plot if you choose the same characteristic for both the axes. Please use different characteristics for different plots. SANKEY Experiment .node rect{ cursor:move; } .node text { pointer-events: none; } .link:hover { stroke-opacity: .5; } Field Gender Race From Career &emsp; Field Gender Race From Career &emsp; Alluvial: &emsp; From these plots, we can infer the various distribution of students. Here are some of the important observations: Most males and females are European/Caucasian American. Least males are Black/African American while least females fall into the other category. Most Latino/Hispanic American students are from Chile, Mexico and Colombia. Most Asian/Pacific Islander/Asian American students are from Taiwan, Toronto and Baltimore. Most Black/African American students are from Brooklyn and California. Majority of the females aim to become lawyers while majority of the males aim to be either lawyers or have a career in consulting. Most males are studying MBA, while most females are studying law.

One of the driving factors for choosing this paper has been the paucity of visualizations that form an intuitive and simple proof of stated results. This book is an attempt to provide explanations for some of the results put forth in the paper by leveraging the tools of data analysis and visualization in R. The process is exhaustive of beginning with understanding the dataset, cleaning and transformation of the raw data to a queriable format proceeded by analysis of missing data and static visualizations of constructed questions and a proof of a few results stated in the paper. What’s more, we have concluded with an interactive visualization of Alluvial flow diagram that gives an overall picture of participant’s preferences over other categorical attributes that were cumbersome to be included in the earlier static visuals. While most of the questions and inferences have been addressed, we want to dedicate this sections to some concluding remarks that this project has helped us draft about the dataset and the experiment as a whole. 7.2 Final Remarks 7.2.1 Structuring of Dataset The raw dataset is pretty intimidating with 190+ columns and about 8000 different records. While we have employed techniques to tackle with this high dimensional dataset, we believe that the experiment could have been better structured in recording values. There are instances where some of the dimensions are missing for an entire logical partition of the experiment which is termed as the wave. This is a misnomer to someone who looks at the entire dataset which subjectively gives an impression that the values have been deliberately missing. Instances where the entire column is missing for a wave doesn’t provide an interesting results even in visulizations. We believe that paritioning the dataset into different files and include columns that were actually recorded would have been more meaningful. 7.2.2 Intrinsic Property in decision making A trend that we have observed from the Results of the visualizations are, participant’s actual decision on matching with the participant’s she/he met with are different from their previous perception of their expectations of an ideal partner. We have observed instances where the importance that was placed upon a specific attribute of their ideal partner before the experiment has resulted in positive matches despite the missing proportionality of that attribute in their dates. This hints to an existence of intrinsic and possibly qualitative property of a person that influences the decision making and which can’t be accounted for as a quantitative measure. 7.2.3 Biased sample The sample of the experiment has focused upon students from the Columbia University with a high density in the age group of 18-30. There are relatively lesser representation of other groups like the mid-age. This can add some bias to generalizations or inferences made for the entire male vs female decision process. There could be certain commonalities in students particularly from Columbia and within an age group that precludes from making an inference that affects the human population on gender differences in decision making. A more balanced representation of the experiment set would have been preferable. One way to get around this bias is to make inferences specific to the denser age group. 7.2.4 Future work The experiment focuses on the interactions between participants’ for a duration of 4 minutes. Extrapolating this further, we could capture the details of participants’ who were involved in a mutual match after a longer period of interaction time. The new results can uncover answers to questions of whether the affect of decision making from interacting for 4 minutes was indeed accurately reflected in the opinions after a longer period of exposure to each other. This sheds light into the aspects of split second decision making during Speed Dating vs prolonged and thoughtful decision making after a longer period of exposure for males against females.
